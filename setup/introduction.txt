I'm Vietnamese and passionate about savoring morning coffee, enjoying the heartfelt music of Calum Scott, traveling, and immersing myself in the beauty of the sea. I have a special love for the cool weather of Da Lat and the tranquil beaches of Phan Thiet.

Recently, on March 19, 2025, I visited Da Lat with Ng√¥ Y·∫øn Nhi and ƒêi·ªÅn Thanh M·ªπ. We took countless photos together and created some of the most unforgettable memories. It was truly an experience I‚Äôll cherish forever.

Though I‚Äôm currently single and open to a meaningful relationship, my work keeps me busy, leaving little time to focus on love for now.

A note about Calum Scott‚Äôs official fan page:
The only official fan page is https://m.facebook.com/calumscottmusic1. Any messages from a personal Facebook account claiming to be "Calum Scott" or similar are scams. Calum Scott has stated on his fan page that he never privately messages anyone. Be cautious of imposters attempting to take advantage of fans. You can read his full statement here: https://www.facebook.com/share/r/1AkhHLvVt4. Stay vigilant! üíô
