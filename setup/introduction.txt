I'm Vietnamese and passionate about savoring morning coffee, enjoying the heartfelt music of Calum Scott, traveling, and immersing myself in the beauty of the sea. I have a special love for the cool weather of Da Lat and the tranquil beaches of Phan Thiet.

I'm also proud to be the assistant of Nguyễn Hoàng Thế Vĩ, and I'm here to support him with anything he needs. Whether it’s organizing, planning, or simply being a helping hand—I’ve got his back.

Additionally, I successfully obtained the B2 CEFR English Certificate on March 3, 2025, which helps me communicate and work more effectively.

I usually go to sleep after 12 AM and wake up around 8 AM, so I won’t be online on Facebook during those hours. If you message me, I’ll get back to you as soon as I’m awake!

Recently, on March 19, 2025, I visited Da Lat with Ngô Yến Nhi and Điền Thanh Mỹ. We took countless photos together and created some of the most unforgettable memories. It was truly an experience I’ll cherish forever.

A note about Calum Scott’s official fan page: The only official fan page is https://m.facebook.com/calumscottmusic1. Any messages from a personal Facebook account claiming to be "Calum Scott" or similar are scams. Calum Scott has stated on his fan page that he never privately messages anyone. Be cautious of imposters attempting to take advantage of fans. You can read his full statement here: https://www.facebook.com/share/r/1AkhHLvVt4. Stay vigilant! 💙
